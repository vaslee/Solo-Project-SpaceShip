# SpaceShip
Since my childhood spaceship was my most played and favorite game. As a soft engineer, I would like to make one for my own. Hoping my app will also be a help to people who are new to SpriteKit.

## Getting Started
SpriteKit is the tool used to call the Kits to start code. The game has a ProgrammaticUI setup. SpriteKit has functions that make it easy to understand how to implement the structure of your game.

## Overview
I start create 3 swift files call : GameScene, MeueScene, and EndScene. As the name of the file, GameScene is what we code for the most part of the game, I added my ship, enemy ship, bullte, etc. And MeueScene, is the first scene that user will see when they enter/run the game, this is optional only for people who wants their game to be more better and options. I will add some button and labels to be welcome for user to start the game. Also, there some future I want to add to MenuScene. EndScene, will be the last scene when user is win or lose. This scene will able to show the user's ceurrent score. 

## Prerequisites

## Features
