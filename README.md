# Solo-Project-SpaceShip
This is the the favorite game I was pley when I was little. And as become as soft engineer, I like to make this little game for my own. I research a lot of resources online. Hoping this will helps people who likes to start learning SpriteKit.

## Getting Started
This game is base on the SpriteKit and Programmatic to set up the game. And there some functions set up easy way for beginners to get undersantd better about what to call in each function.
