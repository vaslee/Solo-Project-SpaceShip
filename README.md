# SpaceShip

## Getting Started
SpriteKit is the tool used to call the Kits to start coding for game. This game has a ProgrammaticUI setup. SpriteKit has functions that make it easy to understand how to implement the structure of your game.

## Overview
In this game, I set up three scene for this game to run with: GameScene, MeueScene, and EndScene. As the name of the file, GameScene is what I code for the most part of the game, I added my ship, enemy ship, bullte, etc. And MeueScene, is the first scene that player will see when they enter/run the game. EndScene, will be the last scene when player is win or lose. This scene will able to show the player's ceurrent score.
